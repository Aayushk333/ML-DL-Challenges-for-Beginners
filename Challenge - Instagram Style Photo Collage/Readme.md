# Instagram Style Photo Collage

## Use OpenCV and Numpy to build a photo collage

In this exercise, we will build a photo collage using 5 images of pokemon as given in the dataset. The sample collage image and images to use in the collage are given in the ImageCollage dataset folder.


Task required to be performed : 

You need to resize each pokemon 200X200 before using it. The final image should have size 430 X 430 px

_(10 border + 200 pokemon + 10 border + 200 pokemon + 10 border = 430 px) along row and column._

After that you need to convert the final image into a single .csv file of the shape (rows x cols, 3).
